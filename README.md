# Visual filtering referable object

## Author

Done by Pedro Padilla Reyes as final dissertation of the Undergraduate Degree in Computer Engineering in UGR.

## The project

The aim of this proyect is to develop a software with an user interface that should be simple and
intuitive that shows a canvas with different visual objects which are easily distinguishable by their
properties, such as geometric shape, color, size or location.

We will develop an application that includes the possibility of working with scenes that have
randomly generated sets of objects, and importing and exporting the scenes with their objects
through system generated files.

The software will allow to delete sets of objects of the scene by using referential expressions that
the user may say as voice commands. The voice commands can also be used for controlling the
majority of the applicationâ€™s functionalities, and we will simulate a conversation of the user with the
system through a virtual assistant that will make using the system easier.

The referential expressions that can be used for deleting sets of objects may be suggested by the
system, in order to help the user find expressions that refer big sets of objects.


## Compilation

You can download this files and compile the app yourself. 

To do it, its necessary to have a few dependencies installed:
- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8 is obligatory.
- Visual Studio to compile and even publish the app if you want is strongly advised.

To compile the app, if you have these two dependencies, you just have to download this repo, open it with Visual Studio and config the compiler or just click "start".
